# TemplateManager
Just a quick template manager to copy templates on a button press. Also includes some scripting to add pre-set items, or the date.

***Release Notes***

V0.0.0 - Project Start!

v0.0.1 - Added the buttons which put templates in Templates.txt to the users clipboard, some scripting flags. Added Settings to set some of the values used by script flags. Settings Window added, and acces to template file added. Demo.

***Planned Features (Warning: Doing this for fun in my free time. Updates will be slow, if at all)***

1.) Add or Remove Template Windows dynamically. 

2.) Dynamically allocated Templates, so the user can add as many as needed. Getting Scrolling to work would be good too.

3.) Open Email Templates with default email client. 

4.) Improved code (As always, this is just a quick project, so main.cpp is spaghetti)
