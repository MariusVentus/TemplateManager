# TemplateManager
Just a quick template manager to copy templates on a button press. Also includes some scripting to add pre-set items, or the date.

***Release Notes***

V0.0.0 - Project Start!

V0.0.1 - Added the buttons which put templates in Templates.txt to the users clipboard, some scripting flags. Added Settings to set some of the values used by script flags. Settings Window added, and acces to template file added. Demo.

V0.0.2 - Templates now have no hard max, and window size partially adusts to the number of Templates! Also, fixed a bug where adjusting the last template risked creating a infinite loop.  
Also adding a flag!

***Planned Features (Warning: Doing this for fun in my free time. Updates will be slow, if at all)***

1.) Add or Remove Template window to make creation easier. 

2.) Getting Scrolling to work would be good too.

3.) Open Email Templates with default email client. 

4.) Improved code (As always, this is just a quick project, so main.cpp is spaghetti)
