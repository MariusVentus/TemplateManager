# TemplateManager
Just a quick template manager to copy templates on a button press. Also includes some scripting to add pre-set items, or the date.

***Release Notes***

V0.0.0 - Project Start!

***Planned Features (Warning: Doing this for fun in my free time. Updates will be slow, if at all)***

1.) Create buttons which copy existing templates in a Template.txt file to the user's clipboard.

2.) Template Scripting, and a settings window to setup things like username or email. 

3.) Add or Remove Template Windows

4.) Dynamically allocated Templates, so the user can add as many as needed. Getting Scrolling to work would be good too.

5.) Improved code (As always, this is just a quick project, so main.cpp is spaghetti)
