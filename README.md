# TemplateManager
Just a quick template manager to copy templates on a button press. Also includes some scripting to add pre-set items, or the date.

***Release Notes***

V0.0.0 - Project Start!

V0.0.1 - Added the buttons which put templates in Templates.txt to the users clipboard, some scripting flags. Added Settings to set some of the values used by script flags. Settings Window added, and access to template file added. Demo.

V0.0.2 - Templates now have no hard max, and window size partially adjusts to the number of Templates! Also, fixed a bug where adjusting the last template risked creating a infinite loop.  
Also adding a flag!

V0.0.3 - Dynamically add Templates through an "Edit Template" window, and rescale the window to accommodate (without having to restart the program), and boost max auto-scale size to a little under Window Max height. 
More Flags, and a Manual for the flags too!

V0.0.4 - Working Scrollbar with mouse scrolling! Fixed bug with multiple template additions and removals in a row.

V0.0.5 - Added options for clearing all templates, restoring from a default, and editing existing templates. Templates can now also have empty lines for improved formatting. 

V0.0.6 - Improved error handling, ability to add "File" Templates, which execute a chosen file!

V0.0.7 - Swap Buttons! Alter the position of templates in the list! Also, quick Bug Fix for "File" Template creation, and added a safety check for execution. Demo and Alpha!

***Planned Features (Warning: Doing this for fun in my free time. Updates will be slow, if at all)***

1.) Improved code (As always, this is just a quick project, so main.cpp is spaghetti)
